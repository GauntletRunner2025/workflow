**Testing Rules**

- Do not create new worlds in tests. Use World.DefaultGameObjectInjectionWorld
- Do not create or instantiate new Systems. All the logic should already be there
- Edit mode tests should just call into a public static function of an existing system.
- Follow [ExampleEditorTest.cs](mdc:ecs.windsurfrules/examples~/ExampleEditorTest.cs) to ensure proper testing conventions.
- Test files should be independant .cs classes, do not inherit from anything.
- Tests belong in either Tests/Runtime or Tests/Editor.
- Tests are already segregated into their own assembly so no fancy namespace stuff is needed.
- To interact with the ECS, use `World.DefaultGameObjectInjectionWorld.EntityManager` or whatever.
