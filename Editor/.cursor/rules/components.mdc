**Components Rules**

- Each Component must be in its own file with a matching name.
- Create as many Components as needed.
- Components should have a single field named `Value` whenever possible.
- State is conveyed by presence/absence of a Component rather than boolean fields.
- Use tag Components for true/false states.
- Components should have fields, not properties.
- Do not include logic or functions in Components; logic belongs in Systems.
- Naming: Do not append `Component` to the type name.
- Components must extend from `IComponentData`.
- Class Components should be used for string fields.
- Tasks (`Task<>`) must be on a class Component, not a struct Component.
- When deserializing JSON, use `[JsonValue]` to map JSON fields to `Value`.
- JSON handling uses `Newtonsoft.Json`.
- String Components should be class-based and use regular `string` fields, not `FixedString64` or similar.
