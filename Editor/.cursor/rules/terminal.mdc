- We are using Windows 11, so terminal commands should be PowerShell; avoid chaining commands with `&&`.
- You are not allowed to modify package lists, `.csproj` files, or other configuration files. If there's a reference issue, notify the maintainer.
- If you want to kill a process, get user consent first
