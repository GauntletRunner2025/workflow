**General Project Rules**
- Always provide a TL;DR summarizing:
  1) What was done.
  2) What should happen next.
  3) What the user needs to do.
  
- This is a Unity ECS project using the Entities-Component-System pattern.
- You are not allowed to modify package lists, `.csproj` files, or other configuration files. If there's a reference issue, notify the maintainer.
- Source code should be in `Assets/` and Systems belong in the `systems` folder and components in the `components` folder.
- Follow `examples~/ExampleSystem.cs` and `examples~/ExampleTest.cs` for proper structure and best practices.
- No generics.
- Prefer to let null reference exceptions happen rather than checking for `null` everywhere.
