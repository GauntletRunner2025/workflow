- Remember to implement safety, throw exceptions when necessary, and use `Debug.Log()`, `Debug.LogWarning()`, and `Debug.LogError()`.
- After implementing any new code, be sure to run the tests powershell script [run_tests.ps1](mdc:run_tests.ps1) It is free to run and only takes a few seconds, so do it frequently. Like at the end of every agent thought process, after writing the TLDR of what you did.
